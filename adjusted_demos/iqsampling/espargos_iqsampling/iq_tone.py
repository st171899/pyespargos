"""Reference CW tone planning: frequency reach, high-band placement, sweeps.

The controller's reference tone generator has two regimes (all measured on
hardware, 2026-07-07):

- up to ~2497 MHz the exact WiFi-channel tone API places the tone with kHz
  resolution (``set_reftx_tone``);
- above that, a forced-VCO-cap path reaches ~2680 MHz (``set_reftx_tone_freq``
  with an explicit ``cap``): the VCO free-runs, its frequency set by the coarse
  cap in ~4.7 MHz steps, reproducible to ~1 MHz within the accurate table.

This module holds the measured cap->frequency tables and the pure planning
functions; the RPC keying lives in :class:`espargos_iqsampling.iq_pool.IQPool`.

# ~1 MHz; ~4.7 MHz per cap step (so placement is accurate to ~±2.4 MHz). cbw and
# divider code do NOT affect the forced-cap frequency, and the fine offset is not
# a usable trim under a forced cap, so the cap is the only knob. cap<47

# with temperature (caps 43-46 measured 7-16 MHz run-to-run), so it's excluded —
# the reliable ceiling is cap 47 / ~2634 MHz. Board process variation adds a
# fixed sub-MHz-to-few-MHz shift (acceptable; read exact off the waterfall).
